# DogelonMines
Small minesweeper-style game in the Dogelon universe. 

Developed for the Elongevity Hackathon 2022 event. Two devs made it from scratch in about 4 days, the entire thing is written in Delphi 11 and full source code can be found on our github. The main goal was to prove that pretty cool games and apps can be built really quickly, all you need is motivation and some skill.

# Game goal
Solve 30 levels with 5x5 boards each containing 3 mines. Each safely uncovered tile grants 1 point in score, every correctly flagged mine grants 10 points at the end of each level.

# Privacy and data
Game does not collect any data, though it's possible a future expansion will bring the possibility to submit a discord username alongside the hi-score. If that is ever implemented, the option to delete user's data (scores) will point to Elongevity discord, as no data is ever stored by the game itself or the devs who made it.
